              <p>
                I'm a mechatronics engineer really passionate about robotics and embedded systems with around 5 years of hands-on and R&D experience. 
                I'm originally from Colombia and I have been living in France for almost 3 years. 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Originally from Cúcuta, a city in eastern Colombia. I received a B.Sc. 
                in Mechatronics Engineering from Universidad Autónoma del Caribe and an M.Sc. also in Mechatronics Engineering, 
                but this time from University of Oviedo in Spain.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This experience has given me strong confidence on working with ROS/ROS2 enviroments, FPGA-based systems,
                Software and Hardware integration, 
                Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had the chance to study and collaborate with 
                multicultural teams on a wide range of projects. These diverse experiences have not only sharpened my 
                technical expertise but also expanded my approach to innovation and problem-solving.
              </p>

              <p>
                I thrive on challenges and aspire to achieve impactful milestones in my career. 
                I'm excited to bring my skills and passion to your team and contribute to your company's success. 
                Let's create something remarkable together!
